### Built with

- React using vite

### What I learned

- React State Management useState
- Bootstrap icons
- Use of functions
- Grid CSS
- Dynamic Component rendering with props
- Map function
- React Slick Carousel

- my json data data was treated as HTML when data.json was anywhere else other than in public folder this is because files in public are served by the development server directly.
   <!--  errorUncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON -->

### Running the Application

- Download zip or clone on local environment
- Navigate to rpoject workspace and install dependencies -> npm i
- Run the application -> npm run dev

### Improvements

- Make it external user ready by prompting the user for data and append the data.json can accept only links to files or:
- modify to accept and store files
